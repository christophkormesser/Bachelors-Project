# Documentation Bachelor Project

## Abstract

This project's purpose is to accompany my bachelor's thesis with the current working title "A Comparative Analysis of Centralized and Decentralized Security Models in a Microservices Architecture". It consists of three dummy web applications written in Go which expose APIs.
The current focus lies on Authentication and Authorization on various levels like Service-to-Service Communication as well as User (Human) to Service Communication. To implement these functionalities I use [Istio Service Mesh](https://istio.io/) and [Kong Gateway](https://konghq.com/products/kong-gateway).

## Roadmap

- [x] Functioning Kubernetes Cluster

  - [x] Istio Observability with Grafana, Jaeger & Prometheus
  - [ ] Define Metrics to Gather
- [x] Kong Gateway Running exposing Applications
  - [x] Kong Authentication Key-Auth
  - [ ] Kong Authentication JWT/OAuth2
  - [x] Kong Authorization ACL
  - [x] Kong Observability with Grafana & Prometheus
  - [ ] Define Metrics to Gather

# Getting Started

Clone the [git repository](https://github.com/christophkormesser/Bachelors-Project)

```shell
git clone https://github.com/christophkormesser/Bachelors-Project
```

## Run the Ansible Playbook

Install Ansible (macOS)
```shell
brew install ansible
```

Change to the root directory of this repository and run the main playbook with
```shell
ansible-playbook ansible/main-setup.yaml
```

Decide which setup you want implement at the beginning of the playbook:

| Option               | Applications | Observability | Authentication | Authorization |
|----------------------|--------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| (i) Istio            | x            | x             | x              | x             |
| (k) Kong OSS DB-less | x            | x             | x              |               |
| (ke) Kong Enterprise | x            | x             | x              | x             |
| (v) Vanilla          | x            | x             |                |               |

### Istio

tbd

### Kong Enterprise
After the playbook is finished make the services in the cluster accessible to your host machine

```shell
minikube tunnel
```

To make changes to Kong, you might need to forward the port to the Admin API

```shell
kubectl port-forward -n kong service/kong-cp-kong-admin 8001
```
